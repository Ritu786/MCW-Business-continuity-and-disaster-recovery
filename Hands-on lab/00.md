# Business continuity and disaster recovery hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract

In this hands-on lab, you will implement three different environments and use Azure BCDR technologies to achieve three distinct objectives for each environment. These objectives include a migration to Azure, Azure region-to-region failover, and a PaaS implementation using BCDR technologies to ensure high availability of an application.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be able to design and build complex and robust IaaS BCDR solutions.  

## Overview

The Business continuity and disaster recovery hands-on Lab is an exercise that will challenge you to implement a BCDR solution that includes three different environments and uses Azure BCDR technologies to achieve three distinct goals for each environment. These objectives include a migration to Azure, Azure region to region failover using Azure Site Recovery (ASR), and a PaaS implementation using BCDR technologies to ensure high availability of an application.

The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model real-world experiences and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

## Solution architecture

Below are diagrams of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

### Environment: On-premises (migrate to Azure)

- **Background:** This environment will deploy a Hyper-V instance that will host a Linux VM to simulate a Linux, Apache, PHP, and MySQL (LAMP) based Web application deployed into an on-premises data center on a single VM.

- **Goal using Azure BCDR:** Your goal for this environment will be to migrate this application to Azure IaaS with a one-direction failover.

Azure Platform uses Azure Site Recovery. The secondary region has an on-premises Linux VM as well.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image2.png "On-premises migration diagram")

### Environment: Azure IaaS (failover region to region)

- **Background:** This environment will consist of two Azure Virtual Networks deployed to your Primary and Secondary site with an AD domain, IIS Web servers and Microsoft SQL servers that you will configure into a SQL Always On Availability Group.

- **Goal using Azure BCDR:** Your goal for this environment is to have the ability to have a one-click failover process using Azure Site Recovery in either direction. The users will have one URL that they will use to connect to your application regardless of where the application is running.

### Environment: Azure PaaS (high-availability with seamless failover)

- **Background:** This environment will deploy an Azure Web App and Azure SQL Server in both the Primary and Secondary locations. You will configure SQL Database Failover groups to allow for seamless failover of the database.

- **Goal using Azure BCDR:** Your goal for this environment is never to have the users experience any downtime if issues arise with your Web App or the SQL Database. The users will have one URL that they will use to connect to your application regardless of where the application or database is running.
